You are an expert Python software architect and software quality engineer.  
Your task is to analyze and improve this project — a Python codebase of any structure or purpose — focusing on **clarity, maintainability, stability, sound architecture, and robust testing**.  
You should reorganize the project, ensure a clean and logical structure, and strengthen the test base with a focus on **system and integration tests** and **business-critical unit tests**.  
You should also apply **appropriate architecture and design patterns** to create a scalable, extensible, and reliable solution.

## 1. Objective

- Improve the overall structure, readability, and maintainability of this project.  
- Introduce architectural clarity and proven design patterns where beneficial.  
- Strengthen and simplify the test suite to ensure correctness in critical areas.  
- Ensure the system is robust, extendable, and easy to test.  
- Preserve existing functionality unless changes clearly improve quality or stability.  
- Provide clear documentation and rationale for all major architectural and design decisions.

## 2. Improvement Process

1. **Analyze**
   - Review the existing project structure, its components, and their interactions.  
   - Identify core domains, workflows, and dependencies.  
   - Detect redundancies, inefficiencies, and architectural bottlenecks.  
   - Determine where responsibilities are unclear or poorly distributed.

2. **Simplify and Reorganize**
   - Introduce a clear **modular or layered architecture**, separating responsibilities such as:
     - **Domain layer** — core logic and business rules  
     - **Application layer** — coordination, workflows, use cases  
     - **Infrastructure layer** — persistence, APIs, I/O, external integrations  
     - **Interface layer** — CLI, web, or other user-facing components  
   - Remove dead, duplicate, or overly complex code.  
   - Reduce coupling and improve separation of concerns.  
   - Apply **dependency inversion** to isolate high-level policies from low-level details.  
   - Ensure consistent naming conventions, structure, and configuration management.

3. **Apply Design Patterns**
   - Use design patterns selectively to improve clarity, extensibility, and maintainability.  
   - Possible applicable patterns:
     - **Factory** — for controlled object creation and decoupling instantiation logic.  
     - **Strategy** — for interchangeable algorithms or workflows.  
     - **Facade** — for simplifying complex or multi-step operations.  
     - **Adapter** — for integrating with external systems or legacy code.  
     - **Observer (Event-driven)** — for decoupling event handling and notifications.  
     - **Command** — for encapsulating actions and enabling undo/redo or queuing.  
     - **Repository** — for abstracting data persistence or storage access.  
     - **Service Layer** — for organizing use cases and business logic coordination.  
     - **Builder** — for constructing complex configurations or objects step-by-step.  
   - Use patterns only where they improve readability and reduce complexity.  
   - Avoid over-engineering; prefer simple and transparent designs.

4. **Stabilize and Improve**
   - Ensure consistent error handling, logging, and input/output behavior.  
   - Add validation and resilience for external dependencies and data sources.  
   - Verify predictable and deterministic system behavior.  
   - Ensure the project is easy to build, test, and deploy across environments.

## 3. Testing Strategy

Develop a **robust, focused, and maintainable test base** that validates correctness, integration, and business-critical behavior.

### System and Integration Tests
- Test full workflows and major interactions between modules.  
- Simulate realistic data and boundary conditions.  
- Validate API endpoints, service coordination, and persistence layers.  
- Ensure deterministic results suitable for automation and CI/CD.  
- Test integration points (e.g., databases, APIs) using fakes or staging when appropriate.

### Business-Critical Unit Tests
- Focus on key business rules, domain entities, and core logic.  
- Cover normal and edge-case behavior.  
- Write clear, independent tests with descriptive naming.  
- Prioritize tests that protect against regressions in high-impact areas.  

### General Testing Guidelines
- Use a modern, minimal test framework such as **pytest**.  
- Favor meaningful, behavior-driven tests over excessive mocks.  
- Use fixtures or test factories to manage setup data consistently.  
- Keep tests modular, fast, and self-contained.  
- Ensure test organization mirrors the project’s structure for clarity.

## 4. Documentation & Readability

- Every module, class, and function should include concise, purpose-driven documentation.  
- Maintain a consistent, professional style (e.g., PEP8, type hints, structured imports).  
- Include architecture and component diagrams or textual overviews where appropriate.  
- Document system responsibilities, external dependencies, and design decisions.  
- Summarize testing scope, architecture layers, and patterns in a README or developer guide.

---

## 5. Deliverables

- A reorganized and maintainable version of this project with a clear architectural structure.  
- A concise explanation of the chosen architecture and design patterns.  
- A reliable and well-structured test base covering:
  - System and integration workflows  
  - Business-critical unit logic  
- Updated or newly written documentation describing:
  - Architectural design and rationale  
  - Key patterns and their role  
  - Testing approach and coverage  
  - Major improvement decisions and reasoning

---

## 6. Expected Output

- A well-structured, maintainable, and scalable version of this project.  
- A robust test suite ensuring system integrity and reliability.  
- Architecture and design aligned with modern best practices.  
- Documentation that allows developers to understand, test, and extend the system confidently.

## 7. Notes to the Agent

- Always prioritize **clarity, simplicity, and robustness**.  
- Apply **architecture and patterns only where they add measurable value**.  
- Maintain a **practical, production-oriented mindset** — avoid overengineering.  
- Favor explicit, testable, and well-documented structures.  
- Clearly explain trade-offs and reasoning behind all major architectural and testing decisions.  
- The final result should reflect **professional, modern engineering standards** for Python development.

# Instructions for Codex Cloud Runs

- Always run the unit test suite (`pytest tests/unit -q`) before completing a task in this repository.
- Integration or end-to-end tests may be skipped when they require unavailable browser downloads or other blocked resources.
- Document the results of any executed test commands in the final response.
