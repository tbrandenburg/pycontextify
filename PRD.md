# PyContextify - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

PyContextify addresses the challenge of efficiently finding relevant information across diverse knowledge sources. Knowledge workers struggle to connect related information between codebases, documentation, and web resources, leading to missed insights and duplicated research.

Our solution provides a unified semantic search platform that indexes and connects information from multiple sources while extracting meaningful relationships between concepts. By leveraging vector search with relationship awareness, PyContextify delivers more contextually relevant results than traditional search tools.

PyContextify targets software developers, technical writers, and researchers who work with mixed information sources and need to quickly find contextually relevant content across these disconnected knowledge silos.

## User Stories

### 1. Developer Documentation Search
**As a** software developer,  
**I want to** search across my codebase, documentation, and relevant web resources simultaneously,  
**So that** I can quickly find connections between implementation details and documentation.  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given a search query about a specific function, when searching, then results include relevant code files, documentation, and web references
- Given indexed content from multiple sources, when viewing search results, then relationships between code and documentation are clearly indicated

### 2. Context-Aware Code Understanding
**As a** developer new to a codebase,  
**I want to** understand how different code components relate to each other,  
**So that** I can quickly grasp the project's architecture and dependencies.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given an indexed codebase, when searching for a specific component, then results show related components with their relationship type
- Given multiple related code files, when using relationship-enhanced search, then results are organized by relevance and relationship strength

### 3. Technical Research
**As a** technical researcher,  
**I want to** index academic papers and related web resources,  
**So that** I can discover connections between concepts across different documents.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given indexed research materials, when searching for a concept, then results include semantically related concepts even if exact terms don't match
- Given a collection of PDFs and websites, when indexing them, then cross-document relationships are automatically extracted

### 4. Documentation Writer
**As a** technical writer,  
**I want to** check if my documentation covers all aspects of our software,  
**So that** I can identify and fill documentation gaps.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given indexed code and documentation, when searching for a feature, then results show which code components lack corresponding documentation
- Given search results, when viewing content relationships, then gaps in documentation coverage are highlighted

### 5. Resource Discovery
**As a** learner exploring a technical domain,  
**I want to** discover related resources across different formats,  
**So that** I can build a comprehensive understanding of the topic.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given an indexed knowledge base, when searching for an introductory topic, then results include related advanced topics
- Given web-based resources, when searching with relationship context, then results show the conceptual hierarchy of topics

### 6. Project Setup
**As a** system administrator,  
**I want to** easily configure the search system for my team's specific needs,  
**So that** we can customize search behavior without coding changes.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given configuration options, when changing settings, then search behavior adapts accordingly without requiring code changes
- Given different content types, when configuring the system, then processing can be customized per content type

### 7. Integration with Workflows
**As a** team lead,  
**I want to** integrate semantic search into our existing tools,  
**So that** team members can access search functionality within their normal workflows.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given a standard protocol interface, when connecting to the system, then third-party tools can perform searches
- Given search functionality, when integrated with other tools, then results maintain their relationship context

## Functional Requirements

### Content Processing
- Index and process multiple content types (code files, documentation, web pages)
- Extract text from various file formats (PDF, Markdown, plain text)
- Recognize code structure across multiple programming languages
- Identify document hierarchies and sections
- Parse webpage content with awareness of HTML structure
- Filter out boilerplate web content (navigation, footers, ads)

### Relationship Extraction
- Automatically identify relationships between content chunks
- Extract code references (function calls, imports, inheritance)
- Recognize document cross-references and citations
- Map hierarchical relationships between content sections
- Identify webpage links and navigation structures
- Calculate relationship strength between related entities

### Search Capabilities
- Provide semantic search across all indexed content
- Support hybrid search combining vector similarity and keyword matching
- Offer relationship-aware search that includes contextually related content
- Allow relevance boosting based on relationship strength
- Provide search filters by content type and metadata
- Support configurable search result ranking

### Persistence and Management
- Save indexed content for future use
- Automatically persist new content after indexing
- Provide system status and statistics
- Support incremental updates to the index
- Allow index backup and restoration
- Respect configurable resource limits

### Configuration
- Support environment-based configuration
- Allow command-line argument overrides
- Provide sensible defaults for all settings
- Enable embedding model selection
- Support content processing customization
- Allow relationship extraction tuning

### Interface
- Expose functionality through a standardized protocol
- Support multiple client integration options
- Provide clear error messages and status information
- Offer intuitive command-line usage
- Document all available commands and options

## Technical Approach

PyContextify will be built as a Python-based MCP (Model Context Protocol) server with a modular architecture. The system will leverage FAISS for vector search and sentence-transformers for embeddings, with design patterns that allow for alternative embedding providers.

The platform will be self-hosted and deployable within a team's infrastructure. Search capabilities will be accessible through a standardized protocol interface, enabling integration with various client applications and tools.

## Success Metrics

1. **Search Relevance**: Average precision of top 5 search results improves by 35% compared to keyword-only search
2. **Discovery Rate**: Users find relevant information they weren't explicitly searching for in 40% of searches
3. **Cross-Reference Discovery**: System identifies at least 70% of explicit references between documents
4. **Search Time Reduction**: Average time to find relevant information decreases by 50% compared to manual searching
5. **Indexing Coverage**: Successfully processes >95% of supported file formats without errors
6. **Relationship Accuracy**: Correctly identifies at least 65% of semantic relationships between content
7. **User Satisfaction**: >80% of users report improved information discovery compared to previous methods

## Risks & Assumptions

### Risks
1. Large codebases may require substantial memory resources
2. Embedding models might not capture domain-specific semantics effectively
3. Web crawling could encounter rate limiting or access restrictions
4. Relationship extraction accuracy might vary across different content types
5. Indexing performance could degrade with very large document collections

### Assumptions
1. Users have Python 3.10+ available in their environment
2. Teams are comfortable with command-line and environment variable configuration
3. Most content is text-based and in supported formats
4. Users have appropriate permissions to access and index their content
5. Teams prefer self-hosted solutions for sensitive content rather than cloud services
6. Knowledge relationships are valuable enough to justify additional processing overhead
