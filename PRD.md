# PyContextify - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

Knowledge workers face the challenge of finding relevant information scattered across codebases and documentation. Traditional search tools miss semantic connections between related concepts, forcing users to manually connect information from disconnected knowledge silos. This leads to missed insights, duplicated research, and reduced productivity.

PyContextify provides an intelligent semantic search server that indexes multiple knowledge sources and extracts basic relationship information from content. Through vector similarity search combined with simple relationship tracking (tags, references, and code symbols), it delivers contextually relevant results that connect related information across diverse content types.

The solution targets software developers, technical writers, and researchers who need to quickly discover contextually relevant information across codebases and documentation. By providing relationship-aware discovery, PyContextify transforms isolated search results into connected insights that accelerate understanding and decision-making.

## User Stories

### 1. Developer Documentation Search
**As a** software developer,  
**I want to** search across my codebase and documentation simultaneously,
**So that** I can quickly find connections between implementation details and reference material.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given a search query about a specific function, when searching, then results include relevant code files and documentation references
- Given indexed content from multiple sources, when viewing search results, then relationships between code and documentation are clearly indicated

### 2. Context-Aware Code Understanding
**As a** developer new to a codebase,  
**I want to** understand how different code components relate to each other,  
**So that** I can reduce onboarding time and make informed changes without breaking dependencies.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given an indexed codebase, when searching for a specific component, then results show related components with clear relationship indicators
- Given search results, when exploring code relationships, then I can understand component dependencies without manual code analysis

### 3. Technical Research
**As a** technical researcher,  
**I want to** index academic papers and internal research notes,
**So that** I can discover connections between concepts across different documents.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given indexed research materials, when searching for a concept, then results include semantically related concepts even if exact terms don't match
- Given a collection of PDFs and notes, when indexing them, then cross-document relationships are automatically extracted

### 4. Documentation Writer
**As a** technical writer,  
**I want to** check if my documentation covers all aspects of our software,  
**So that** I can identify and fill documentation gaps.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given indexed code and documentation, when searching for a feature, then results show which code components lack corresponding documentation
- Given search results, when viewing content relationships, then gaps in documentation coverage are highlighted

### 5. Resource Discovery
**As a** learner exploring a technical domain,  
**I want to** discover related resources across different formats,  
**So that** I can build a comprehensive understanding of the topic.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given an indexed knowledge base, when searching for an introductory topic, then results include related advanced topics
- Given complex documentation, when searching with relationship context, then results show the conceptual hierarchy of topics

### 6. Project Setup
**As a** system administrator,  
**I want to** easily configure the search system for my team's specific needs,  
**So that** we can customize search behavior without coding changes.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given configuration options, when changing settings, then search behavior adapts accordingly without requiring code changes
- Given different content types, when configuring the system, then processing can be customized per content type

### 7. AI Assistant Integration
**As an** AI assistant user,  
**I want to** leverage PyContextify's search capabilities within my AI workflows,  
**So that** I can get contextually relevant information from my organization's knowledge base.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given an MCP-compatible AI assistant, when connecting to PyContextify, then the assistant can search across indexed content
- Given search results from PyContextify, when used in AI conversations, then relationship context enhances the quality of responses

### 8. Integration with Development Tools
**As a** team lead,  
**I want to** integrate semantic search into our existing development workflows,  
**So that** team members can access search functionality within their normal tools.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given a standard protocol interface, when connecting development tools to the system, then searches can be performed programmatically
- Given search functionality, when integrated with IDEs and documentation tools, then results maintain their relationship context

## Risks & Assumptions

### Risks
1. Large codebases may require substantial memory resources
2. Embedding models might not capture domain-specific semantics effectively
3. Processing large documents may require additional memory or time
4. Relationship extraction accuracy might vary across different content types
5. Indexing performance could degrade with very large document collections

### Assumptions
1. Users have Python 3.10+ available in their environment
2. Teams are comfortable with command-line and environment variable configuration
3. Most content is text-based and in supported formats
4. Users have appropriate permissions to access and index their content
5. Teams prefer self-hosted solutions for sensitive content rather than cloud services
6. Knowledge relationships are valuable enough to justify additional processing overhead
